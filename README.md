# Misc-Scripts-and-Utils
Just a buttload of scripts I use on a basis, Figured I'd upload it for others to use :D

I'll keep a list of them right here for you wads.
(Windows)
1.)OneDrive Remover
2.)Windows 10 Service Disabler (Based on BlackVipers. Will add the rest when I find them.)
3.)Recursive Shutdown Stopper (I had a weird bug where Windows kept issuing a shutdown command. this is what I used to fix it.)


(Universal)
1.)Modded Hosts File (For all your adblocking needs)
